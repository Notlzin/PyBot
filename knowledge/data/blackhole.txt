A black hole is an astronomical body so compact that its gravity prevents anything from escaping, even light.
Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will form a black hole.
The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon.
In general relativity, a black hole's event horizon seals an object's fate but produces no locally detectable change when crossed.
In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.
Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.
This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.
In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterise a black hole.
Due to his influential research, the Schwarzschild metric is named after him. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity.
The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.
